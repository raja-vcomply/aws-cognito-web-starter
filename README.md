# AWS Cognito Web Starter

A simple starter project for using AWS-Cognito SDK in the web browser.

[Try the Demo](https://f1lt3r.github.io/aws-cognito-web-starter/index.html)

## About

This code takes the example code from the [AWS Cognito JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cognito-identity-js), and implements it in the most simple way I know how: _an HTML page with 1 JavaScript file_. The purpose of this is to vet the service and API before implementing it in product.
